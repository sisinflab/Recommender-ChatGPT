Based on the user's liking for The Giver and Siddhartha, I would recommend The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Great Gatsby, Brave New World, The Hobbit, Frankenstein, Crime and Punishment, The Scarlet Letter, and The Lord of the Rings. These books share similar themes of self-discovery, societal critique, and adventure. Additionally, based on the user's liking for Ellen Hopkins' books, I would recommend Cut (novel), Incarceron, and Dexter in the Dark. These books share similar themes of mental health, identity, and self-discovery. Finally, based on the user's liking for The Count of Monte Cristo, I would recommend The Stand, which shares similar themes of revenge and redemption.
