Based on the user's liking for books by Kurt Vonnegut and Chuck Palahniuk, I would recommend the following books in the top 50:

1. The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
3. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
4. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
5. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
6. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
7. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne
8. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
9. The Stand by Stephen King
10. Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll

These books are all classics in their own right and have themes and styles that may appeal to someone who enjoys the works of Vonnegut and Palahniuk.
