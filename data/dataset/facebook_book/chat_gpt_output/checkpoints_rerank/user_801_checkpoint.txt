Based on user 801's liking for The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, The Time Machine by H. G. Wells, and Tess of the d'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy, I would recommend the following books in the top 50:

1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
3. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
4. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
