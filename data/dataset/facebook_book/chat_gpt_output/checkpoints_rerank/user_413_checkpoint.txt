Based on the user's liking for books by Bob Ong and Jane Austen, I would recommend the following books:

1. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
2. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
3. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
4. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
5. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne
6. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
7. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
8. The Stand by Stephen King
9. Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll
10. The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux

These books are all classics that have stood the test of time and are likely to appeal to someone who enjoys literature. Additionally, I would recommend the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, as it is a popular series that has a wide appeal and may be of interest to the user.
