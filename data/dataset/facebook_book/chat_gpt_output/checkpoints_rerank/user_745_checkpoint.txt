Based on the user's liking for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Catcher in the Rye, I would recommend The Great Gatsby, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Crime and Punishment as they are all classic novels with similar themes of disillusionment and societal critique. Additionally, since the user enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha, I would recommend The House of Mirth and Pygmalion as they also explore themes of class and societal expectations. For a change of pace, I would recommend The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as they are both epic fantasy novels with rich world-building and engaging characters. Finally, for a more contemporary recommendation, I would suggest The Maze Runner and Across the Universe as they are both popular young adult novels with thrilling plots and interesting characters.
