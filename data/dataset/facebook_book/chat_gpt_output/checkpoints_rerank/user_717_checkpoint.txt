Based on the user's liking for Impulse economy and Bowie: A Biography, I would recommend The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Great Gatsby, Brave New World, The Hobbit, Frankenstein, The Lord of the Rings, and The Stand. These books share similar themes of self-discovery, identity, and personal growth, which align with the user's interests. Additionally, I would recommend The Maze Runner, Across the Universe (novel), and Incarceron, as they are popular young adult novels with similar themes of adventure and self-discovery. Finally, I would recommend Crime and Punishment and The Scarlet Letter, as they are classic novels that explore themes of morality and redemption, which may appeal to the user's interest in character development.
