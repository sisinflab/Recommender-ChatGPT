Based on the user's liking for The Catcher in the Rye and Fear of Flying, I would recommend the following books:

1. The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
3. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
4. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
5. Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
6. The Maze Runner by James Dashner
7. The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau
8. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
9. The Giver by Lois Lowry
10. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
11. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne
12. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
13. Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw
14. The Stand by Stephen King
15. Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll

These books are a mix of classic and contemporary literature, with themes of coming-of-age, self-discovery, and societal critique. They also have elements of mystery, fantasy, and dystopia, which may appeal to the user's taste.
