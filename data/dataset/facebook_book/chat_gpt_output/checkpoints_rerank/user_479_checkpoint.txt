Based on the user's liking for City of Bones and City of Ashes, which are both young adult fantasy novels, I would recommend the following books in no particular order:

1. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
2. Twilight Eyes by Dean Koontz
3. The Maze Runner by James Dashner
4. The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau
5. The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris
6. W.I.T.C.H. by Elisabetta Gnone
7. Vampire Kisses by Ellen Schreiber
8. A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket

These books are all in the young adult or fantasy genres and have similar themes and elements to the books that the user has already enjoyed. Additionally, I would recommend The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, as they are both classic fantasy novels that have a similar feel to the Mortal Instruments series.
