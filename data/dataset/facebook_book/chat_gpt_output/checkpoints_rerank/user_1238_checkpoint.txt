Based on the user's liking for Mythology and Interview with the Vampire, it seems that they enjoy books with a mythical or supernatural theme. Therefore, I would recommend the following books in no particular order:

1. Dracula by Bram Stoker
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
3. The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris
4. Twilight Eyes by Dean Koontz
5. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
6. The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux
7. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
8. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
9. Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
10. A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket

These books all have elements of mythology, supernatural creatures, or fantasy that may appeal to the user based on their previous reading preferences.
