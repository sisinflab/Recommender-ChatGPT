Based on the user's liking for Franny and Zooey by J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, and Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, I would recommend the following books in no particular order:

1. The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera
2. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
3. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
4. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
5. Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
6. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
7. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
8. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne
9. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
10. The Stand by Stephen King

These books share similar themes and styles with the user's previously liked books, such as coming-of-age, existentialism, and dystopian societies. Additionally, the user's liking for The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay by Michael Chabon suggests an interest in fantasy and adventure, which is why I included Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings in the recommendations.
